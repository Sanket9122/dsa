<!-- Algorithm to Find Union of Two Sorted Arrays 
Initialization:
Create an empty list (or array) union to store the unique elements from both arrays.
Initialize two pointers, i and j, to 0. These pointers will be used to traverse the two arrays, a and b, respectively.
Traverse Both Arrays:

While both pointers are within the bounds of their respective arrays:
If a[i] < b[j]:
Check if a[i] is not already in union (to avoid duplicates):
If union is empty or the last element in union is not equal to a[i], add a[i] to union.
Increment pointer i (move to the next element in array a).
Else if b[j] < a[i]:
Check if b[j] is not already in union:
If union is empty or the last element in union is not equal to b[j], add b[j] to union.
Increment pointer j (move to the next element in array b).
Else (if a[i] == b[j]):
Check if a[i] (or b[j], since they are equal) is not already in union:
If union is empty or the last element in union is not equal to a[i], add a[i] to union.
Increment both pointers i and j (move to the next elements in both arrays).
Add Remaining Elements:

After one of the arrays is fully traversed, check for any remaining elements in the other array:
While there are remaining elements in array a:
Check if a[i] is not already in union:
If union is empty or the last element in union is not equal to a[i], add a[i] to union.
Increment pointer i.
While there are remaining elements in array b:
Check if b[j] is not already in union:
If union is empty or the last element in union is not equal to b[j], add b[j] to union.
Increment pointer j.
Return Result:

Return the union list containing all unique elements from both arrays.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of array a and m is the length of array b. This is because we traverse each array at most once.
Space Complexity: O(n + m) in the worst case if all elements are unique and added to the union list.
Example Walkthrough
Let's illustrate the algorithm with an example:

Input:

Array a = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
Array b = {2, 3, 5, 7}
Step-by-Step Execution:

Initialization:

union = []
i = 0, j = 0
First Iteration:

Compare a[0] (1) and b[0] (2).
1 < 2, so add 1 to union.
Increment i to 1.
union = [1]
Second Iteration:

Compare a[1] (2) and b[0] (2).
They are equal, add 2 to union.
Increment both i and j to 2 and 1, respectively.
union = [1, 2]
Third Iteration:

Compare a[2] (4) and b[1] (3).
3 < 4, so add 3 to union.
Increment j to 2.
union = [1, 2, 3]
Fourth Iteration:

Compare a[2] (4) and b[2] (5).
4 < 5, so add 4 to union.
Increment i to 3. ->
